# How to create a HockeyApp App iOS

## Apple Developer Member Center

In the Certificates section

* New APP ID
	* Add an ID Description `My App`
	* As bundle identifier choose `de.my_url.my_app`

* Create Distribution `Provisioning Profile` - Ad Hoc
	* Choose `Ad Hoc` for sharing a beta verison with some users or `In-House` for an Enterprise release
	* Choose just created app id
	* Choose certificate.
		* If it doesn't exist create one. But ask team-members for the certificate signing request `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest`. It's easiest if the entire account uses the same one.
		* There should be two certificates in total. One for development and one for production.
	* Choose devices
