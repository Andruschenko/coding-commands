## Distribute npm package

You something cool in JavaScript, want to share it with the world and want a step-by-step instruction on how to publish this thing on **npm**?

### New npm package

1. Create an [npm account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup)
2. Run `$ npm login` to login to your (newly created) npm account.
3. Run `$ npm init` to start a guided process to fill out fields like *license*, *homepage*, *version* etc.
4. Test your package locally by running `$ npm install ../path/to/your/project` from some other folder. Also check your install instructions in the **README** file - they will be displayed alongside the npm package.
5. Run `$ npm publish` to publish your package.
6. It may take a little bit until your package is live - then check it out on the npm homepage.

These steps were taken from this [overview](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/developers).

### Update npm package

My npm update routine for my open source projects to create new version numbers.

1. Run `npm version <update_type>` (see [this link](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages)) where `<update_type>` equals `patch`, `minor`, or `major`.

    Update types adhere to the principle of **semantic versioning**:

    - In a version `2.0.3`, `2` is the `major`, `0` the `minor` and `3` the `patch` position.

2. Update the project's `CHANGELOG` and add that change to the commit generated by the `npm version` command via `git commit --amend`.

    - In case you don't have a **CHANGELOG.md** file yet, the [CHANGELOG of the styled-component library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/styled-components/styled-components/master/CHANGELOG.md) might serve as a nice template. It's the example which I follow in my open source projects.

3. Run `npm publish` to publish the update.
4. Run `git push` to push your changes to GitHub.
5. Run `git push origin --tags` to push the newly created tag to the remote repository so that you can add release notes there.
6. Go to the Github page of the project, then to `release`.
   - There to the `tags` tab and then click on the three dots `...` in the row of the new release you want to add notes to.
   - There you choose "create a new `release`".
   - Add the created CHANGELOG entry as release notes plus anything else you want to say.

**Note**: In step 1 you can run `npm version patch -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"` to update with a message.

### npm version in GitHub repo README

1. Go to <https://badge.fury.io/> and create your npm badge which you can then add to your GitHub README file.
2. Copy the Markdown version of the generated badge.

Example in case the package is called `my-package`:

```md
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/my-package.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/my-package)
```

## More on Semantic Versioning

In a `package.json` file you'll encounter versions with `~` or `^`. This is what it means:

Depending on whether you prepend `~`, `^` or *nothing* to the version `2.0.3` the following `jQuery` package version will be installed when you run `npm install` or `yarn` in each case:

1. `~`
   - `"jQuery": "~2.0.3",`: Most recent `jQuery` version up to **patch** release will be installed
   -

2. `^`
   - `"jQuery": "^2.0.3",`: Most recent `jQuery` version up to **minor** release will be installed
- `"jQuery": "2.0.3",`: That particular `jQuery` version will be installed

In the `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file you can confirm which exact version is installed

```js
core-js-pure@^3.0.0:
  version "3.6.4"
  resolved "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/core-js-pure/-/core-js-pure-3.6.4.tgz#4bf1ba866e25814f149d4e9aaa08c36173506e3a"
