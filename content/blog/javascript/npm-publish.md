## Distribute npm package

You created a cool JavaScript or TypeScript project, want to share it with the world and want a step-by-step instruction on how to publish this thing on **npm**?

Here you go!

### New npm package

1. Create an [npm account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup)
2. Run `$ npm login` to login to your (newly created) npm account.
3. Run `$ npm init` to start a guided process to fill out fields like *license*, *homepage*, *version* etc.
4. Test your package locally by running `$ npm install ../path/to/your/project` from some other folder. Also check your install instructions in the **README** file - they will be displayed alongside the npm package on [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/).
5. Run `$ npm publish` to publish your package.
6. It may take a little bit until your package is live - then check it out on the npm homepage.

These steps were taken from this [overview](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/developers).

### Update an existing npm package

My npm update routine for my open source projects.

1. Run `npm version <update_type>` (see [this link](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages)) where `<update_type>` equals `patch`, `minor`, or `major`.

    Update types adhere to the principle of **semantic versioning**:

    - In a version `2.0.3`, `2` is the `major`, `0` the `minor` and `3` the `patch` position.

2. Update the project's `CHANGELOG`

    - Add a new entry for the new version you're about to release
    - At the bottom of the `CHANGELOG` update the link of the `unreleased` version and create a link for your new version.

    - You don't have a **CHANGELOG.md** file yet? - The [CHANGELOG of the styled-component library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/styled-components/styled-components/master/CHANGELOG.md) might serve as a nice template. It's the example which I follow in my open source projects.

3. Add this `CHANGELOG` change (and perhaps other changes) to the commit generated by the `npm version` command via `git commit --amend`.

4. Run `npm publish` to publish the update to the npm server from your local computer.

The `npm` part is done. Now we add a **tag** and release to **GitHub**:

5. Run `git push` to push your changes to GitHub.
6. Run `git push origin --tags` to push the newly created tag to the remote repository so that you can add release notes there.
7. Go to the Github page of the project, then to `Releases` on the right-hand side.
   - There to the `Tags` tab at the top. There click on the three dots `...` on the right-hand side of the row with the new release tag and click on `Create release`.
   - As **title** pick your new version with a `v` in front, e.g. `v2.9.0`.
   - Click on `Auto-generate release notes` or add the created `CHANGELOG` entry as release notes plus anything else you want to say.

**Note**: In step 1 you can run `npm version patch -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"` to update with a message.

### `npm` version in GitHub repo README

1. Go to <https://badge.fury.io/> and create your npm badge which you can then add to your GitHub README file.
2. Copy the Markdown version of the generated badge.

Example in case the package is called `my-package`:

```md
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/my-package.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/my-package)
```

## More on Semantic Versioning

In a `package.json` file you'll encounter versions with `~` or `^`. This is what it means:

Depending on whether you prepend `~`, `^` or *nothing* to the version `2.0.3` the following `jQuery` (it's just an example) package version will be installed when you run `npm install` or `yarn` in each case:

1. `~`
   - `"jQuery": "~2.0.3",`: Most recent `jQuery` version up to **patch** release will be installed (i.e. `2.0.something`)

2. `^`
   - `"jQuery": "^2.0.3",`: Most recent `jQuery` version up to **minor** release will be installed (i.e. `2.something.something`)
- `"jQuery": "2.0.3",`: That particular `jQuery` version will be installed (i.e. `2.0.3` and nothing else)

In the `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file you can check which exact version is installed

```js
core-js-pure@^3.0.0:
  version "3.6.4"
  resolved "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/core-js-pure/-/core-js-pure-3.6.4.tgz#4bf1ba866e25814f149d4e9aaa08c36173506e3a"
