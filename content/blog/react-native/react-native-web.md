## `react-native-web`

### Styled Components

- Object mode vs. string mode
- [css-to-react-native](https://github.com/styled-components/css-to-react-native)

### Forms and Buttons

- React Native `onPress` and form.send

  TODO: What does `form.send` stand for here?

- React Native Web inserts a `button type="submit"` with opacity of zero in web.
