## Affinity Photo

### Blur certain area of photo

1. In the Photo Persona in the left column pick the `Rectangular Marquee tool (M)` and create a rectangle.
2. On the right choose the layer tab and then click on the lower botton which looks like a sand clock (i.e. `Live Filters`)
3. Choose `Gaussian Blur...` and increase the radius.

### Cut out an image

### Cut out something out of image

1. Pick the `brush selection` tool.
2. Choose a pencil width
3. Left click while moving the cursor and don't worry about too much selection
4. Left click + press the `Alt` key to remove selection which you don't want.
5. Hit `Refine` on the top left
6. In the `Layer` tab on the right, select your layer and in the bottom row click on the `Mask Layer` button.
7. Go to `File` > `Export` as **png** and use it later.

### Add into other image

1. Go to `File` > `New` to create a new Image window
2. Create a new layer: In the layer column on the right, at the bottom right one of the small buttons creates a new layer.
3. Drag and drop the newly created **png** image in.

## Affinity Designer

### Move with transformation vs. without

* Button is on the top right.

### Flatten svg files

[found it at this link](https://affinity.serif.com/forum/index.php?/topic/564-outline-stroke/)

1. Go to `Layer/Expand Stroke`.
2. Export to `svg`

Only weird part missing: it's exported as `responsive` because it shows width and height as 100% and not as its actual values.
