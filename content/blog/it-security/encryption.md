## Authentication vs. authorization

> Authentication and authorization might sound similar, but they are distinct security processes in the world of identity and access management (IAM).
> Authentication confirms that users are who they say they are.
> Authorization gives those users permission to access a resource.

- **Authentication**: Did user login successfully?
- **Authorization**: Is user allowed to view this page? For example, has the user got "admin" rights to view the admin dashboard?

## Zero-knowledge proofs

### Decentralized Authentication

- [NuID](https://github.com/NuID) created a tool for decentralized authentication which [can be used in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/implementing-passwordless-email-authentication-with-amazon-cognito/).
- [This articles](https://dev.to/turbopape/nuid-trustless-authentication-using-zero-knowledge-proofs-on-the-blockchain-4cch) describes the idea.
