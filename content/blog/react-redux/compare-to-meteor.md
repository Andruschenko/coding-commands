I'd compare the difference of a React-Redux app to e.g. a meteor app as comparing elephants (? months of pregnancy + ? years to independence) to birds (? months of pregnancy + ? years to independent life).

If you're able to build and fully understand a [Todo App with React + Redux](https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/step-by-step-guide-to-building-react-redux-apps-using-mocks-48ca0f47f9a#.qrbuj8eqm), you're up an running to create a fully fleshed production ready web app.
If you're able to write a todo app with meteor, there's still very much to learn to pull of something more sophisticated although it's great to get small projects running fast if you need server and client.
