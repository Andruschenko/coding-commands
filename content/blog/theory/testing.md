What is out there in the world of testing. This article categorizes them briefly and introduces you to some advanced testing concepts you might not have yet heard about.

## Different types of testing

### Unit Testing

Check that a single function does what it should do.

e.g. `mocha`/`chai` or `jest`

### Integration Testing

Render a certain part (e.g. component) of an app without many mocks to check that it does what it should do.

Mostly uses same technology as unit testing.

### End-to-end (a.k.a `e2e`) testing - also called **functional testing** or acceptance testing

Simulates a real app user and runs that virtual user through the entire app experience.

I sometimes heard people to call integration test and end-to-end tests the same thing.

## Advanced testing topics

### Test coverage

Most often via code-coverage, e.g. via Jest

### JSON schema validation

Use [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) to e.g. validate incoming JSON form data with a library like <https://github.com/tdegrunt/jsonschema> or <https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv>

For typescript generate a schema with one of the following tools:

- [QuickType](https://app.quicktype.io/)
- [typescript-json-schema](https://github.com/YousefED/typescript-json-schema) or

For JS create a JSON schema yourself or use [one of these tools](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7341537/tool-to-generate-json-schema-from-json-data#answer-30294535).



```js
import { validate, ValidationError } from 'jsonschema';

const generatedJSONSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    id: { type: ['null', 'number'] },
    name: { type: ['null', 'string'] },
    description: { type: ['null', 'string'] },
    pictureFileName: { type: ['null', 'string'] },
    instituteName: { type: ['null', 'string'] },
    instituteLogoFileName: { type: ['null', 'string'] },
  },
  required: [
    'description',
    'id',
    'instituteLogoFileName',
    'instituteName',
    'name',
    'pictureFileName',
  ],
  $schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#',
};

export const validateFeaturedAuthor = (obj: {}): ValidationError[] => {
  const { errors } = validate(obj, generatedJSONSchema);
  return errors;
};
```

```js
// Usage
...
const errors = validateFeaturedAuthor(parsedJSONFile);
```

### Property Based Testing

[What is Property Based Testing?](https://hypothesis.works/articles/what-is-property-based-testing/)

> Randomly generated test cases based on defined properties (like [QuickCheck](https://begriffs.com/posts/2017-01-14-design-use-quickcheck.html) does for Haskell).

- [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check) is a property based testing framework for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- [Hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis) is also a big framework in the space of property based testing which has a bit of a different philosophy as compared to QuickCheck.

### Snapshot testing

Test and update snapshots of components. [See the docs](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html)


## Test driven development (TDD)

> [...] in TDD, the tests tell you

- what to do next
- what to do,
- how to do it
- what your design is
- how to structure your code
- when you are done.

Contrast to **Type** Driven Development (TDD)

> However, "design with types first" doesn't exactly mean what you think it means.
> The idea is that you use types to model your problem domain and **let the types drive the design and development**.
