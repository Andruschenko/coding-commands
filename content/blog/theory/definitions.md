- **Singleton**

  - Restrict the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance ([see the wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern))

  - This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

- `debounce`:

  - it limits the rate at which a function can fire
  - In `redux-saga` is non-blocking.

- **idempotent**: When applying a function multiple times, the state won't change after applying it the first time.

  - A function we can retry several times until it works! Yeah!

- **idiomatic**: Idiomatic in the context of programming can usually be defined as "the most natural way to express something in a language"

- **imperative** vs. **declarative**

  See [the article which compares imperative vs. declarative](./imperative-declerative.md)

- literal vs statement vs expression

    **literals**:

    Representing a value within source code.

    - `"foo"` (a string)
    - `true` (a boolean)
    - ...

    Not **literals**:

      - `std::cout` (an identifier - refer to a value in memory)
      - `foo = 0;` (a statement)
      - `1+2` (an expression)
