## Tree shaking

**tree shaking**: Use named imports instead of global imports

```js
import { namedImport } from "../utils";
```

**cherry-picking**:

```js
// This still pulls in all of lodash even if everything is configured right.
import { sortBy } from "lodash";

// This will only pull in the sortBy routine.
import sortBy from "lodash-es/sortBy";

```

## Code splitting

Only load files which are necessary on each route
