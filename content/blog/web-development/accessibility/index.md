## How to make something accessible?

Check the following

derived from [Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)

1. What **is** this thing?

  - element **role** (e.g. a `Link`)
  - accessible **name** (e.g. `Contact Us`) and current **state** (e.g. `checked`/`unchecked`)
  - accessible **name** (also called **label** or **text**)

  **Example**: Screenreader reads out role (e.g. `button`)

2. What happens when I **click** this thing?

  Give context.

  **Example**:

  - Visual hint via icon exists, but screenreader won't know.

  ```js
  accessibilityHint="Opens in a new window"
  ```

3. Did clicking *the thing* meet my **expectations**?

  Help user feel `successful` so she doesn't question the quality of the app or doubt herself.
