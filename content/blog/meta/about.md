## Why did I create this?

Since I'm working as a developer, I made notes about syntax and topics I find difficult and about commands I found useful or suspected that I will need them again at some point.

## Why did I put this online?

I had all my notes in *Markdown* files anyway and I sometimes had a hard time finding them because they are all somewhere on my computer. I used *Spotlight* as my search tool, but want to improve it by having them all in one place.

I also hope that other people might find my notes helpful.

## Information about the content

- I'm gradually adding more of the files I have on my computer, cleaning, checking and revising them beforehand (sometimes more, sometimes less).
- Main future features will be a search and a better look.
- Some pages only contain very basic information for the simple tasks I mostly used it for or just wanted to remember whereas some pages are more elaborate. Other pages contain more in depth discussions and theory.
- This page will move to a separate about section.
