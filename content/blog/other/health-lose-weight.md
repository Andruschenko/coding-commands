## Nutrition

[This video of Sasha Huber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqBBgrLph4s) explains the science of losing weight perfectly.

### Calorie deficit

**Simple**: Calorie deficit

[Compute your necessary calorie supply](https://www.yazio.com/de/kalorienbedarf-berechnen)

What my body normally needs: **2100** (no weight increase)
Reduce Weight: **1700** or **1600**

e.g. use **myfitnesspal** to count calories

1. Eat what you really like. 
2. Do baby steps
3. Trust the process
4. Don't see it black or white - you can never be perfect!

### Protein

- [Generally recommended](https://www.dge.de/presse/pm/wie-viel-protein-brauchen-wir/): 0.8 or 1 gramm per kg body weight -> 70g (2 shakes)
- To build muscles: 2 gramm per kg body weight -> 140g (4 shakes)

### Fat

**Unhealthy**: Gesättigte Fettsäuren

### Body recomposition

Body recomposition = Reduce weight + gain muscle at the same time.

Read about body recomposition [here](https://www.fitness-insights.at/body-recomposition/) (in German)

### Flatten your stomach 

1. Plank as long as you can
2. Reduce stress in your life
3. Water: If you feel hungry down a glass of water
4. Pilates - trains internal and external muscles 
5. Eat **fiber**: Reduces number of calories the stomach absorbes: Cereals, paris, nuts, potatoes, broccolies
6. Cut the carbs - whole grain bread, brown rice, quinoa
7. Go for more walks
8. Fix your posture
9. Eat peanut butter - 2 table spoons of peanut butter is the perfect meal to flatten your belly

## 6-pack in 6 weeks

[Very tough routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ0S9mToQgo):

**Training**:

**Abs Training**: 3 days a week
**Other muscles training**: 3 days a week
**Cardio**: 30 min every day - no exceptions

**Diet**:

Breakfast: Eggs + Outmeal + Apples *or* **Plain Greek Yoghurt** with banana on lighter days
Lunch: Protein source (chick-breast or veggy patty) with broccoli and assorted vegetables
Snack: Small bowl of lentil soup
Dinner: Protein source + broccoli and spinach

At week 3 add some calories to diet:

Lunch: 3/4 cups of rice to lunch

Ast week 5 abs show but 1 inch body fat still visible

**Ab vacuum technique**

Body-building [Ab vacuum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdzrYvgvv3o) technique: 

1. Deep breath in
2. Exhale all your air out
3. Suck in belly button back to your spine (create reverse pressure) 
2. Hold your breath until you can't anymore

- Every morning: At the beginning do it just for 5-10 sec (3-4 repeptitions - maximum a minute), later hold it for 20 seconds, 30 seconds - you get better and better control and it will become easier for you.
- You can feel it cramping in lower belly region.
- You also develop the ability to hold your breath longer

### Whole eggs or egg whites?

- Verdict: Eat whole eggs! See [this article](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/flex-nutrition/whole-eggs-vs-egg-whites/)



### How fast do you lose muscles without training?

[Video from Sascha Huber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3_uwmApfpc)

- You can go without training for 3 weeks -> First, not muscles but Glycogen is lost (which binds a lot of water) --> You look like you have less muscles, but you can quickly gain them again.


### Carbs & Proteins

- **Low carb**: Below 130 grams of carbohydrates per day
- **Protein**: 2.4 grams per kg of body weight --> if you weigh 70kg you should eat 168 grams of protein.


### Motivation
