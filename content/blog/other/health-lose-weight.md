### Science of losing weight

It's simple: If you establish a **calorie deficit** you lose weight.

[This video of Sascha Huber (in German)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqBBgrLph4s) explains the science of losing weight perfectly.

#### Calorie deficit

[Compute your necessary calorie supply](https://www.yazio.com/de/kalorienbedarf-berechnen)

What my body normally needs (this calorie intake leads to no weight increase): **2100**
Reduce Weight: **1700** or **1600**

- üì≤ use the app [myfitnesspal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) to count calories.

### Protein

#### How much protein?

- [Generally recommended](https://www.dge.de/presse/pm/wie-viel-protein-brauchen-wir/): 0.8 or 1 gramm per kg body weight -> 70g (2 shakes)
- To build muscles: 2 gramm per kg body weight -> 140g

To reduce the calorie content of this meal, here are some suggestions:

1. Reduce the amount of oil: Consider reducing the quantity of Raps Canola Oil used in the meal or using a cooking spray instead. Oil is calorie-dense, so using less can significantly reduce the overall calorie count.
2. Use a lighter cooking method: Instead of sunny-side-up eggs, you could try poaching or boiling them, which requires less oil or fat for cooking.
3. Opt for lean protein sources: While fake meat can be a convenient option, it's often processed and may have a higher calorie content. Consider incorporating leaner protein sources such as grilled chicken, fish, or tofu, which can be lower in calories.
4. Increase vegetable portions: Vegetables are generally low in calories but high in nutrients. Increasing the proportion of vegetables in the meal can help create a more balanced and satisfying plate while reducing overall calorie intake.
5. Be mindful of sauces and seasonings: Pay attention to the calorie content of sauces, including dark soy sauce, as they can add significant calories. Look for lower-sodium options or consider using herbs, spices, or vinegar to add flavor instead.
6. Monitor portion sizes: Be mindful of portion sizes for the preserved beans, fake meat, and other ingredients. Sometimes smaller portion sizes can still provide flavor and satisfaction while reducing calorie intake.

### How fast do you lose muscles without training?

[Video from Sascha Huber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3_uwmApfpc)

- You can go without training for 3 weeks -> First, not muscles but Glycogen is lost (which binds a lot of water) --> You look like you have less muscles, but you can quickly gain them again.


### Carbs & Proteins

- **Low carb**: Below 130 grams of carbohydrates per day
- **Protein**: 2.4 grams per kg of body weight --> if you weigh 70kg you should eat 168 grams of protein.
