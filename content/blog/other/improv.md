## Improv games

### Name/get to know each other games

- **Zombie name game**: Form circle. One person is the zombie in the middle and slowly moves towards a random person. The person which is "attacked" has to make eye-contact with another person who then shouts out a different name to force the zombie to move there.

    Alternative: The person to whom the zombie walks to can also call out another name.

- **Present other**: Choose a partner, share facts about yourself for 1 minute, then present the other person.
- **All at once**: Stand in a circle and ask all people to choose the person diagonal of them as partner. When you say go everyone tries to find out as much as they can of the person opposite of them. It will get very loud! Then you present the other person. The person being presented is not allowed to correct while the other is speaking. Only when the person is finished she is asked whether everything was right and she can correct mistakes.
- **10 Fingers**: Ask yes/no questions in the group. However can't say yes, looses a finger. Person with one finger left wind. E.g. "I have a cat"
- **Accepting Circle**: Move one gesture + sound around in the circle
- **Memorize names + gesture**: In circle, repeat all mentioned names with their gesture and add your own. It's a difficult memorization exercise for the last person in the circle. üòâ


  - Variation: Person makes gesture and others guess their quality.
  - Variation: **Action Syllables** - different movement for every syllable in name
  - Variation: **Name + quality with gesture** - e.g. "I'm Tom and I am quick thinker".

- **Eights** (also called **Crazy Chicken**/**Shake down**): Shake arms and legs 8 times, 7 times, 6 times, ... until we reach 1 and jump
- **Zen Counting (Digits/No Doubles/Count up)**: Form a circle, heads down, eyes closed and count up to 20, one person naming a number, one-by-one. If two people say a number at the same time we have to start at zero again.
- **Oh yeah! / Yes, let's!**: "Let's all do jumping jacks" - "Oh yeah!", "Let's all touch our cheeks" - "Oh yeah!" - "Oh yeah!", "Let's all look at our thumbs with awe" - "Oh yeah!"
- **Die - not today**: "Die - not today", "This is a big bowl of spaghetti - oh thank you", "Hawk - to me hawk"
- **Count without the 3 (Fuzzy Ducky)**: In a circle, count up to 40 person by person, but instead of every multiple of 3 or where a 3 is part of the number, that person just claps.

    Alternative: Also replace the 7 and multiples of 7.

- **Smart Fellas**: "one smart fella HE felt smart.", if its NOT multiple of 3 or with a 3 in it: "two smart fellas THEY felt smart.", if it's a multiple of 3 or with a 3 in it: "3 smart fellas THEY ALL felt smart" ...after last one all together say "and they all felt smart together".
- **Blink** (*no language*): Form circle with two rows. Each person has a person standing behind them. One standing person has no one sitting in front of them. This person blinks to another sitting person which has to run to the empty chair. The person standing behind her has to try to stop her from getting to the other spot.
- **Ha Soh Kah**: Put index and middle finger together horizontally on your forehead and says "Ha". The next player (left or right - where fingers of first player point to) puts index and middle finger near chin and says "Ha". Last person says "Kah", pointing to another player with both hands. If someone makes a mistake they are out "Ha Soh Kah - you're out!".
- **You - remembering patterns**: Everyone in a circle. Everyone raises their right hand. Point to person in circle and continue. Remember pattern (order) of people and repeat. Then switch places in the circle. Repeat the pattern. Close your eyes, and repeat the pattern. Now this is repeated with favorite animal/food ...

- **Exaggeration Circle**: Moving little sound or gesture with increasing intensity
- **Ha-ha-haya**: Look at a person and say "Ha" (move both arms to front), the receiving person says "Ha" and moves both their arms up, then the persons to the left and right of the receiving person say "Haya" while moving their arms like swords towards the belly of the receiving person. Than the receiver makes a new "Ha" towards another person. Whoever makes an error is out for this round. The last two get into a duel to shoot.

- **Beat/Rhythm detective**: One person has to leave the room. Group decides who the beat leader is and all people copy the beat of the leader. Person comes back in. Everyone does the beat as the beat leader who changes the beat frequently to give the detective a chance to figure out who the leader is.
- **Whisky Mixer**: clockwise: Whisky Mixer, counterclockwise: Mister Whisker (German: Wax Maske), Max Mutzke (or "Misty Vista") to go diagonal or to change direction.
