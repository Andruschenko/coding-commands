## Wait but why: How to choose a career

[How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)

## Creativity and Purpose

### Sir Ken Robinson: How school kills creativity

Which role does education play in our search for our purpose?

In `How school kills creativity` **Sir Ken Robinson** describes the story of the lady which eventually wrote the Cats musical. He also tells the story in his [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_do_schools_kill_creativity) - the most viewed TED talk of all times.

1. Creativity of humans
2. Uncertainty / Unpredictability of the future

> Education takes us into the future we can't grasp

> If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with something original

> Creativity: Having original ideas which have value


In his second talk

> Education dislocates many people from their talents.

> Challenging things which we believe are obvious.

> Tyranny of common sense

**Note**: His book "The Element" is all about finding your purpose.

### Ikigai

**Ikigai**: The Japanese secret to a long and happy life

## Refuse to choose by Barbara Sher

According to a framework of Barbara Sher there are two types of humans: **Scanners** and **Divers**.
She writes about it in her **Book** [Refuse to Choose](https://www.amazon.com/Refuse-Choose-Interests-Passions-Hobbies/dp/1594866260).

A certain group of people (i.e. scanners) it's particular difficult to find their ideal career path

### Scanner

**Who is a scanner?**

> Intense curiosity about numerous unrelated subjects is one of the most basic characteristics of a Scanner.

Taken from Barbara Sher's blog post [Are you a scanner?](http://www.getmotivation.com/motivationblog/2017/04/barbara-sher-scanner/).

### Diver

**Who is a diver?**

A violin virtuosa cannot imagine a happy life in which you don't play the violin every single day for several hours.

### Society prefers Divers

Historically socity prefers divers. In the following TED Talk a species very similar to that of a scanner (or is it the same?) is discussed:

- A so-called [multi-potentialate](https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling?language=en).
