Today I read about the concept of **consciousness raisers** in [Richard Dawkins "The god delusion"](https://amzn.to/3gyJGTg).
Learning about this concept raised mine and it might raise yours!

## Examples of consciousness raisers

### Feminism:

- **Her**story vs. **His**tory

- **Interesting**: Even radical voices (e.g. calling someone a `niger`, raise consciousness about a topic.

### Darwinism

...

### Other consciousness raisers:

* Visiting different cultures
* Homo Deus: Thinking about our treatment of animals when thinking about how superior forms of humans would treat us
* Explaining why positive stereotypes cause harm ("positive" racism)
