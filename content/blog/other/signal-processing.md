## Questions to answer:

- How can radio or other waves confuse animals?
- How can 5G have a better reception indoors?
  - Actually worse, but more towers and better geared towards them.
- What’s the difference between LTE and 3G/5G?
  - LTE is basically a 3.5G+. It's a protocol which does not adhere to the 4G standard but it got so close that it's the same quality.

## Phone tower



——————

 This is why your router has better range in your house in 2.4GHz mode than in 5GHz mode. The higher frequencies of 5G networks are even worse at getting through brick/concrete.

Bigger wavelength = lower frequency -> can get through brick/concrete better.

So visible light (5g is a type of light that we just can’t see) is a much bigger fish, so it gets caught/hits the net that is a wall (for example), while 5g and most radiowaves are slimmer so can slip through the cracks just fine.


	- This argument is probably simplified to the point of not really being correct. Radio waves are in fact longer wavelengths than visible light and yet can go through walls. X-rays on the other hand are shorter wavelengths and can also travel through walls. It isn't really the size of the light wave relative to the material that matters, it's the energies involved.


Sound waves don't go through walls. The waves hit the wall, the wall vibrates, then new sound waves are created on the other side of the wall. Nothing traveled through.


## Electromagnetic spectrum

### Penetrating walls

- Longer wavelength of radio allows it to penetrate walls while visible and UV light cannot.

- Why WI-FI can penetrate walls but light cannot?

## 5G

5G is not just one change, it's a series of different new approaches to change the way information is sent over the air.


### Dangerous?

- In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4pxw4tYeCU) he says no, because although 5G has a higher frequency it's not in the range of X-Ray which can heat up the body.
