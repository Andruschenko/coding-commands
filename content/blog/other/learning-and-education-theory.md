## Learning hacks

1. **Exploration** vs. **exploitation** dilemma (reinforcement learning)

   Watch videos at 3x speed ([Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-playback-speed-co/hdannnflhlmdablckfkjpleikpphncik/related) or [podcasts](https://overcast.fm/))

2. Start with most simple explanation

   Google for [ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ELI5) on Reddit

   Use Github as google for code samples

3. Create a set of small achievable goals with deadlines

   --> Maintain a flow state

4. Let your curiosity guide your learning plan.

## Reciprocal Learning Networks - The Future of Education

- Learning has to be practical: **Making** - build it into your everyday activities.

      	e.g. create a website to explain others how to program!

## Experiential Learning

Learned about it in a workshop from **Romy Alexandra Solomon** and **Antonios Triantafyllakis**

Take education to the next level via a journey through these four steps:

1. Immersed in **concrete experience**: Experiencing
2. **Reflective observation**: Reflecting
3. **Abstract conceptualization**: Thinking
4. **Active experimentation**: Acting - So what? How can I apply this.

## Learning approaches

Learning by doing, constructive Struggling, problem-based learning, Flipped Learning, Just in Time Learning

See https://www.teachthought.com/pedagogy/modern-trends-education-50-different-approaches-learning/

### Just in time learning

Read about just-in-time learning [here](https://www.developgoodhabits.com/just-in-time-learning/).

### Faith learning

- You don't know why it's useful now, but trust me (have faith) and you can have **impact** in the future.

Nick del Grosso

- **Impact** has to be well defined - by the students themselves!

### Kumon

[Kumon](https://www.kumon.de/) is a method to learn math and English from Japan.

## Own ideas about learning

### Zero-knowledge proof learning

Die high-level Idee vom Zero-knowledge proof is einfach mega spannend! Ich habe auch dar√ºber nachgedacht, ob man das in Education benutzen k√∂nnte.. damit man keine Angst hat Fehler zu machen. Der Sch√ºler macht irgendwie Fehler, aber der Lehrer und die Mitsch√ºler, wissen nicht welchen, oder obs √ºberhaupt ein Fehler ist, nur dass es anders ist... Keine Ahnung ob das funktioniert... vielleicht k√∂nnen wir mal dar√ºber philosophieren... üòÄ


## Adult learning

Theory: Educational psychology or instructional design

### How to teach complicated theory

Taken and adapted from General Assembly instructor course:

- Share upfront that the lesson will be focused on theory
- Identify the key most important, practical takeaways and boil them down in to easy-to-remember bites (bonus points if you provide a visual).
- Create an opportunity for learners to immediately apply the theory right away, through a reflection, scenarios or hands-on project or assignments.
- Remember that practical application of theory is key for adult learners.
- Make resources available for those folks who are motivated to dive deep.
