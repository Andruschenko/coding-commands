## Learning hacks

1. **Exploration** vs. **exploitation** dilemma (reinforcement learning)

   Watch videos at 3x speed ([Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-playback-speed-co/hdannnflhlmdablckfkjpleikpphncik/related) or [podcasts](https://overcast.fm/))

2. Start with most simple explanation

   Google for [ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ELI5) on Reddit

   Use Github as google for code samples

3. Create a set of small achievable goals with deadlines

   --> Maintain a flow state

4. Let your curiosity guide your learning plan.

## Reciprocal Learning Networks - The Future of Education

- Learning has to be practical: **Making** - build it into your everyday activities.

      	e.g. create a website to explain others how to program!

## Experiential Learning

Learned about it in a workshop from **Romy Alexandra Solomon** and **Antonios Triantafyllakis**

Take education to the next level via a journey through these four steps:

1. Immersed in **concrete experience**: Experiencing
2. **Reflective observation**: Reflecting
3. **Abstract conceptualization**: Thinking
4. **Active experimentation**: Acting - So what? How can I apply this.
