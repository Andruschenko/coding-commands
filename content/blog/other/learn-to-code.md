## Introduction

> Andr√©, if I want to start programming, where should I start?

I get asked this question a lot! This articles is my (elaborate) reply.

### What should I learn first? Web Development, Data Science, AI?

Creating things you can share with others is motivating - Such a thing is a website or an app. That's why I recommend to start with **web development**.

I now present different online courses around the topic of web development which I recommend in the given order:

### How the Internet works

The **Digital Literacy** track of [TeamTreehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/andrekovac) is the perfect way to start for complete beginners who want to get a smooth introduction into the world of technology and the internet.

A very charming lady will use very simple language to teach you about:

- Computer Basics
- How the internet works
- How the web works
- Basics of HTML and CSS - the main languages of the world wide web.

You have to create an account but it's free for 7 days. [Try it for 7 days here](http://referrals.trhou.se/andrekovac).

### Simple code completions

[CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a good start of a learning journey. It could be called the Duolingo of tech education. It's quite nice for a start, because you usually just type out what's given. But you only learn how to mechanically insert commands here. Such knowledge is easily forgotten. Check out their [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript) courses like [Intro to JavaScript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).

### Online courses for particular technologies

- TeamTreehouse and PluralSight offer structured courses.
  - At TeamTreehouse you always see the explanation why something is the way it is and so you understand all the concepts better, feel more confident and can remember it better.
  - PluralSight offer a 10-day trial (https://www.pluralsight.com/codeschool). Runs according to a similar system to TeamTreehouse.

### The complete web developer course

If you are serious about learning web development, the **Complete Web Developer Course** https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/ by *Rob Percival* is my biggest recommendation.

- This course turned me into a software developer. The special thing about the course is that it is **"real-life"**. You don't just program in a fake browser environment. Instead you are taught where to buy web space and how to push your own homepage into the internet - step by step. 
- I have done the first version of the course. The above link is for the second version.

**Tip**: Udemy often offers deals where you can buy the course for around 10 or 20 euros. You don't have to buy the course for the full pric but can wait for a discount.

## Other concepts/ways to learn coding

### Learn in public

It may seem daunting, but if you need to push yourself to actual start to learn a new ambitious skill (like programming) forcing yourself to publicly document your learning journey might help you.

Tania Rascia wrote about [her public learning journey](https://egghead.io/podcasts/switching-careers-and-learning-in-public-with-tania-rascia) in a great blog post.

### Mobile Apps to learn programming

I see more and more people use their smartphones to learn on the go.

Examples: Apps like [Mimo](https://getmimo.com/) or [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/home)

- It's a nice opportunity to learn some coding whenever you get some free time - when sitting on the couch or in the subway after work.
- It can also serve as a segway to more thorough

This trend fits the concept of [bifurcating attention](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00246/full) which I recently came across. People are either consuming enticing short content (YouTube Shorts, TikTok) or engaging long-term content (long-form blog posts, binge-watching Netflix series).

### Certifications

If you want to got an official certification of course completion (to e.g. add it to LinkedIn), these course providers are for you:

#### Nanodegree

[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) offers quite ambitious courses (called nano-degrees) with mentor support. Course videos are kept short (only 2 to 5 minutes) so you can learn in small bites. Also, the certificates are well recognized in the IT scene.

- Udacity also has a range of free courses (which don't earn you a certificate), for example [a course about the version control system git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123).
- Downside: Some courses of rapidly changing technologies (like Frontend development) are outdated. Hence, I wouldn't for example recommend their [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). 

#### Edube

[Edube](https://edube.org/) offers python certifications. You can use their courses to practice for these certifications for free. To get a certification, you buy the right for an exam.

## Q&A

Questions around learning to become a web developer.

### In-person/live courses vs. online courses

> **Question**: As a person with foundational web-dev knowledge, do you think it‚Äôs worth doing a full-tiome course as next steps on journey to become a software developer?

**Answer**: In my view, anyone who is a) highly motivated and ready to tolerate some frustration and b) has or can take the time necessary to code, code and code even more üòÖ can become a great developer. No need for any paid course.

From my experience there are three big things you don‚Äôt receive when learning all by yourself (with tutorials, YouTube Videos and free or paid online courses), but you do receive with a structured course or bootcamp:

1. Frequent individual feedback + support of a teacher, a learning network and fellow students.
2. A structured learning journey which is well researched and thought through.
3. An environment with homework and deliverables which keeps you committed to your goal.

These three points make it much more likely to start üöÄ and to pull through üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è a sometimes hard and frustrating but ultimately very rewarding journey.

**Some further comments**:

- Programs like the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)‚Äôs Nano-Degrees offer great learning journeys and offer personal support but not in a way a live-class would. However, they are way cheaper than live-classes or bootcamps.
- In the beginning of any ambitous learning journey you will face a lot of obsticals and moments where you‚Äôre stuck. In such moments, a support network of fellow students, the teacher and TAs, can help you to accelerate your learning and prevent you of delaying or even giving up when you just can‚Äôt move on.


### Are HTML, CSS & JS foundations enough to get a frontend web dev job?

HTML, CSS & JS foundations are the bread and butter of web development. This knowledge helps you get a sense and first working knowledge of what web development is about.

With such knowledge you will be able to write small websites and web applications. So you will have the right foundation to **begin** your journey of becoming a web developer.

To land a frontend job, I‚Äôd say some exposure to a JavaScript library/framework to write user interfaces and a small example app you wrote (which you showcase in GitHub) and practice to demonstrate your skills in a coding interview can land you a job.

Such frontend frameworks would be [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for example.

### Are frameworks like React JS something you should learn after you've mastered JS, or can you learn it now?

You can easily get lost in fundamentals and it can be demotivating not to work with the frameworks which are used to build modern real-world applications.

That being said, don‚Äôt wait until you feel you *"truely mastered"* JavaScript until you learn your first framework.

Most programmers never feel they have *"fully mastered"* a skill (imposter syndrome can be quite prevalent among developers) and there's always room to understand a programming language in an even deeper way. Also, what does *"mastered"* actually mean? - I think, everyone will have a different conception of it.

I, for my part, know that there are other developers out there who have a deeper understanding of many parts of JavaScript than I'll ever have. However, I am able to call myself an expert of React and React Native - both of which are JavaScript frameworks. Some praise of clients I got over the years gave me the confidence to write such a statement ;-)


### My experience in education

Having taught programming in various forms to hundreds of advanced professionals, beginners, students and kids, I often get asked where to start.

I myself learned the basics of web development via an online course and am continuing to learn more every day.

I hope this guide helps you to initiate your programming learning journey!
