## My experience in education

Having taught hundreds of kids, students and professionals the basics of programming, web development, data science, robotics and cyber security - the question I get asked a lot is:

> Hey, Andr√©, I want to start programming, where should I even start?

People who know me, know that I'm obsessed with online learning! I completed the first ever MOOC that existed and studied

I'm lucky I can give completely unbiased advice here now because I have no affiliates to any learning platform or course creator.

## Where should I start to learn coding?

I think starting with something you can share makes most sense! A website or an app! That's why my recommendations on starting to code evolve around web development.

The content I recommend teaches you the following in this given order:

1. Learn how the internet works
2. Begin to code right away
3.



I'm working on a React Native course to bring direct real-world results and shareability of the web to the medium which is used like none before in history - your mobile phone -

> mobile devices (excluding tablets) generated 52.6 percent of global website traffic

## How the Internet works

In my view the **Digital Literacy** track of [TeamTreehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/andrekovac) is the perfect way to start for complete beginners who want to get a smooth introduction into the world of technology and the internet.

A very charming lady will use very simple language to teach you about:

- Computer Basics
- How the internet works
- How the web works
- Basics of HTML and CSS - the main languages of the world wide web.

You have to create an account but it's free for 7 days. [Try it for 7 days here](http://referrals.trhou.se/andrekovac).

## Practice on the go

I hear more and more people being happy about https://getmimo.com/ as a way to get acquainted with coding - being able to do it in-between - when sitting on the couch or in the subway after work.

## Practice

Der Digital Literacy Kurs (https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/digital-literacy) bietet einen tollen Einstieg und lehrt erstmal was das Internet eigentlich ist und wie das mit den Homepages funktioniert - auf ganz einfache Art und Weise erkl√§rt. Ich empfehle den Kurs zum Starten, wenn man davor nicht viel mit Programmieren am Hut gehabt hat. Man muss sich anmelden, kann es aber f√ºr 7 Tage umsonst anschauen.


- CodeSchool is comparable. They used to be free. Now they have a 10-day trial (https://www.pluralsight.com/codeschool). Wasn't bad either. Everything runs according to a similar system to TeamTreehouse.

- At Udacity, you can be trained as an expert online: https://www.udacity.com/. There are many great courses there, which I like very much because the individual videos are usually very short (only 2 to 5 minutes) and so you can learn in small bites. They advertise their specialisations a lot, but you can also take most of the courses for free without a certificate. I like it a lot, but it's usually a bit more for advanced learners.

	- Udacity also has some free courses, for example git: https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123

- For the sake of completeness, you can also mention https://www.codecademy.com/. It's quite nice for a start, because you usually just type out what's given. But I only learned how to do things mechanically there. You forget things like that pretty quickly. At TeamTreehouse I always get the explanation why something is the way it is and so you understand all the concepts better, feel more confident and can remember it better.

- If you are serious about learning web development, the "Complete Web Developer Course" https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/ by Rob Percival is my biggest recommendation! This course made me a software developer. The special thing about the course is that it is "real-life". You don't just program in the prefabricated browser environment, instead you are taught where to buy web space and how to get your own homepage on the internet - step by step. I have done the first version of the course. I expect the second one to be even better.
Tip: Udemy often offers deals where you can buy the course for around 10 or 20 euros. Do not buy the course for the full price of 200 euros.

- CodeSchool ist vergleichbar. Fr√ºher waren die gratis. Jetzt haben die ein 10 t√§giges Trial (https://www.pluralsight.com/codeschool). War auch nicht schlecht. L√§uft alles nach einem √§hnlichen System wie bei TeamTreehouse.

- Bei Udacity kann man online komplett zum Experten ausgebildet werden: https://www.udacity.com/. Dort gibt es viele tolle Kurse, die mir sehr gut gefallen, weil die einzelnen Videos meistens sehr kurz sind (Nur 2 bis 5 Minuten) und man so in kleinen H√§ppchen lernen kann. Sie machen viel Werbung f√ºr ihre Spezialisierungen, aber man die meisten Kurse auch einfach so ohne Zertifikat gratis belegen. Gef√§llt mir sehr gut, ist aber meist schon etwas mehr f√ºr Fortgeschrittene.

- Der Vollst√§ndigkeit halber kann man noch https://www.codecademy.com/ erw√§hnen. Es ist ganz nett f√ºr den Start, weil man meistens einfach direkt das abtippt, was vorgegeben ist. Aber dort habe ich nur mechanisch gelernt was zu machen.. So was vergisst man recht schell. Bei TeamTreehouse bekomme ich auch immer die Erkl√§rung, warum etwas so ist, wie es ist und so versteht man die ganzen Konzepte besser, f√ºhlt sich sicherer und kann sich das ganze auch besser merken.

- Falls du ernsthaft Web Entwicklung lernen m√∂chtest ist der "Complete Web Developer Course" https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/ von Rob Percival meine gr√∂√üte Empfehlung! Dieser Kurs hat mich zum Software-Entwickler gemacht. Das besondere an dem Kurs ist, dass er "real-life" ist. Du programmierst nicht blo√ü in der vorgefertigten Browser-Umgebung, dir wird stattdessen beigebracht, wo man Web-Space kauft und wie man die eigene Homepage ins Internet bringt - Schritt f√ºr Schritt. Ich habe die erste Version des Kurses gemacht. Ich gehe davon aus, dass die zweite noch besser ist.
Tipp: Udemy bietet oft Angebote, bei denen du den Kurs f√ºr ungef√§hr 10 oder 20 Euro kaufen kannst. Kaufe den Kurs auf keinen Fall f√ºr den vollen Preis von 200 Euro

- After you learned the basics, I can recommend the Udacity Nano-Degree Programs. They might not be top notch offer

## Q&A

### Live course necessary to foster foundational web-dev knowledge?

**Question**: Do you think it‚Äôs worth doing a full-tiome course as next steps on journey to become a software developer?

**Answer**:

**Let me rephrase**: Will you do it all by yourself with tutorials, YouTube Videos and free or paid online courses or would you rather join a structured course or bootcamp like the one offered by GA.

In my view, anyone who is a) highly motivated and ready to tolerate some frustration and b) has or can take the time necessary to code, code and code even more can become a great developer. No need for any paid course.
However, there are three big things you don‚Äôt get when doing it yourself:
Frequent individual feedback + support of a teacher, a learning network and fellow students.
A structured learning journey which is well researched and thought through.
An environment with homework and deliverables which keeps you committed to your goal.
And these three points make it much more likely to start (you already did that! :tada:) and to pull through a sometimes hard and frustrating but ultimately very rewarding journey.

**Some further comments**:

I feel that you have a very strong personal motivation so point 3 does not seem to be too relevant for you.
Programs like the Udacity‚Äôs Nano-Degrees (for example https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019 ) offer great learning journeys as well and offer some sort of support but not in a way a live-class would. However, they are way cheaper than live-classes like GA‚Äôs.
In the beginning you will face a lot of moments where you‚Äôre just stuck. In such moments, a support network and a teacher or TAs you can ask for support can accelerate your learning and prevent you of delaying or even giving up when you just can‚Äôt move on.

### Are HTML, CSS & JS foundations enough to get a frontend web dev job?

The GA FEWD course teaches you the bread and butter of web development, helps you get a sense and first working knowledge of what web development is about. You will be able to write small website and web applications. So you will have the foundational knowledge to begin your journey of becoming a web developer.

To land a frontend job, I‚Äôd say some exposure to a JavaScript library/framework to write user interfaces and a small example app you wrote (which you showcase in GitHub - we will learn about this soon) and more practice to demonstrate your skills in a coding interview can land you a job. Such a frontend framework would be, React.js, Vue.js, Angular or Svelte for example. I can talk about the difference between a JS plugin and a JS framework in the next class. Please remind me of it in case I forget :wink:

### Are frameworks like React JS something you should learn after you've mastered JS, or can you learn it now?

Yes, it‚Äôs a very common thing that something will work on one browser but not on another. What‚Äôs weird in your case: Actually the mobile Safari browser is known for showing many issues other browsers don‚Äôt. But you ended up with an issue on the mobile Chrome browser üòÖ

https://caniuse.com/ is a website where you can check which browsers support certain CSS or JavaScript syntax features.

This brings me to your second question: A big reason to use frameworks like React instead of writing everything in plain (aka vanilla) JavaScript is that they take care of (most) browser-compatibilities for you. The unsupported features will be automatically rewritten by so-called polyfills which come bundled with some frameworks.

That being said, don‚Äôt wait until you feel you ‚Äúmastered‚Äù JavaScript until you learn your first framework. Most programmers never feel they have ‚Äúmastered‚Äù a skill fully (imposter syndrome can be quite prevalent among devs) and you can actually always understand a programming language in a deeper way.
Also, what does ‚Äúmastered‚Äù actually mean? - I think, everyone will have a different conception of it.

I, for my part, know that there are many other devs out there who have a deeper understanding of many parts of JavaScript, but I am able to call myself an expert of React and React Native - both of which are JavaScript frameworks. Some praise of clients I got over the years gave me the confidence to write such a statement ;-)

### My Dojo experience

I took part at [Mob programming session - a dojo](https://www.meetup.com/Munchen-Social-Coding-Dojo/events/273899262/) with [this repo](https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/vending-machine-kata-bootstrap).

### Tools

1. [Mob timer](https://mobti.me/)
2. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) - Share link to collaborate on code

### Start

1. Install dependencies via lock file

	```bash
	python3 -m poetry lock
	```

2. Most simple test

	```python
	import pytest


	def get_the_answer():
	  return 10


	def test_the_answer():
	  assert get_the_answer() == 42
	```

### Mob developing participants

- **Navigator** and **Driver** change every 5 minutes.
- **Navigator** says what to type
- **Driver** types (and controls speed)
- **Mobs** watch, think and observe.

### Process rules

- If one test fails, go to code.

### Team support

After each one was a navigator once Mini Repro

- How are you feeling now?
- Something good we noticed?
