##### Tone changing rules

- [看这片很好的视频](https://youtu.be/rxNHIdn_xjE)

1. Always: 3 + 3 -> 2 + 3
2. Only for 不：4 + 4 -> 2 + 4
3. Only for 数字《一》你算数字时时第一声，可是在任何其他情况下是第四声！而且也遵守上面的规律。4 + 4 -> 2 + 4
   例子：
    - 一杯水 Yìbēi shuǐ （Google gets the 拼音 wrong!）
    - 一起 Yìqǐ
    - 一路 yílù; 一個 yíge (2nd - neutral, but originally a 4th) --- this one is super important!
    - 一條路 yì tiáo lù

- [Summary from hackingchinese.com](https://www.hackingchinese.com/optional-obligatory-tone-change-rules-mandarin/)
  - Obligatory rules: The three above rules
  - Optional tone change rules:
    - 动物 4-4 becomes a slighter 4 and a 4
    - 一年级 yīniánjí (grade one) turns into yīniānjí.

- [Another resource covering the tone change rules with examples](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/Tone_changes_for_third_tones)
  > Sometimes multiple third tones in a row will be broken up by pauses. In this case, the last word/character in each "group" will be pronounced as a third tone.
