## Definition

**Docker Compose** is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container **applications**.

- **Docker Desktop** will group running containers in tabs of different **applications** (same as folder name in which `docker-compose.yml` is located).

## resources

- [awesome-compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/spring-postgres) collects great `docker-compose` files for common App setups.

## `docker compose` file

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running **multi-container** Docker **applications**.

1.  Define a `docker-compose.yml` file, e.g.

    ```yml
    version: "2"

    services:
      voting-app:
        build: ./voting-app/.
        volumes:
         - ./voting-app:/app
        ports:
          - "5000:80"
        links:
          - redis
        networks:
          - front-tier
          - back-tier

      result-app:
        build: ./result-app/.
        volumes:
          - ./result-app:/app
        ports:
          - "5001:80"
        links:
          - db
        networks:
          - front-tier
          - back-tier

      worker:
        image: manomarks/worker
        links:
          - db
          - redis
        networks:
          - back-tier

      redis:
        image: redis:alpine
        ports: ["6379"]
        networks:
          - back-tier

      db:
        image: postgres:9.4
        volumes:
          - "db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"
        networks:
          - back-tier

    volumes:
      db-data:

    networks:
      front-tier:
      back-tier:
    ```

1.  Launch your app. In the same directory as your `.yml` file:

	```bash
    docker-compose up -d
	```

  - `-d` run in **detached mode** in background.

## `profiles`

1. Add certain containers in your `docker-compose.yml` file to a `profile`.
2. When running `docker-compose` that container will only be launched if `--profile {profile_name}` is added.

  e.g. `docker-compose --profile my_profile up`
