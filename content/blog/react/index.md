## `state` vs. `props`

Two types of **model** data in React: `state` vs. `props`

> If a Component needs to *alter* one of its attributes at some point in time, that attribute should be *part of its* `state`, otherwise it should *just be a* `prop` *for that Component*.

[See this article about props vs state](https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/blob/master/props-vs-state.md)

### `props`

* `props` are a way of **passing data from parent to child**.
* `props` are immutable: they are passed from the parent and are **"owned"** by the parent.
* used for sending callbacks to the parent

### `state`

* mutable `state` of the component for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time.
* private to the component and can be changed by calling `this.setState()`

### `render()`

`render()` methods are written *declaratively* as functions of `this.props` and `this.state`.

## Components

### Stateful Component â€” Both props and state

We also call these **state managers**. They are in charge of client-server communication (XHR, web sockets, etc.), *processing data* and *responding to user events*. These sort of logistics should be encapsulated in a moderate number of Stateful Components, while all visualization and formatting logic should move downstream into as many Stateless Components as possible.

e.g. in the tutorial the client-server communication was done in the `CommentBox` component, while the other logic was passed down to the `CommentList` and `Comment` components.

### Functional components (just `render`)

Define all props using destructuring: `const UnstyledButton = ({ text, onClick, variant }) => (`

```js
/**
 * Button represents a default button which accepts three props: text,
 * onClick and variant.
 *
 * Note that this Button needs styles applied through react-css-modules;
 * to use default styles declared here import the 'Button' component.
 */
const UnstyledButton = ({ text, onClick, variant }) => (
    <Button
      styleName={ styles[variant] }
      onClick={ onClick }>{ text }</Button>
);
// Note: 'styleName' is react-css-module's version of the 'className' prop

// Create a Button with the default styles applied
const Button = css(Button, styles);

export default Button;
export UnstyledButton;
```

### Component Life cycle

And here a graphic designed by **Dan Abramov**:

## Refs

Refer to DOM elements with refs, e.g. focus on an input field

```js
React.findDOMNode(this.refs.input).focus();
...
	<input ref='input' value={} />
```

## JSX

```js
var Nav, Profile;
// Input (JSX):
var app = <Nav color="blue"><Profile>click</Profile></Nav>;
// Output (JS):
var app = React.createElement(
  Nav,
  {color:"blue"},
  React.createElement(Profile, null, "click")
);
```

## Mixins

* In component `CameraAction.js`: What is a React mixin? How does the `_mixinFrameStyle()` thing work?

	```js
	this.setState(this._mixinFrameStyle({
		currentAction: ACTIONS.CAMERA,
	}));
	```

  Definition of `_mixinFrameStyle`:

  ```js
	_mixinFrameStyle(state = {}) {
    if (this._lastOrientation) {
      const orientation = this._lastOrientation;
      this._lastOrientation = null;

      LayoutAnimation.easeInEaseOut();
      state.frameStyle = this._frameStyle(orientation);
      state.orientation = orientation;
    }

    return state;
  }

  _frameStyle(orientation) {
    return (
      orientation === LANDSCAPE
        ? FRAME_LANDSCAPE_STYLE
        : FRAME_STYLE
    );
  }
	```

	**Answer**:

	* A mixin mixes something to the response, i.e. here the `_mixinFrameStyle()` mixes the orientation which is stored in an instance variable `_lastOrientation` (received from an event listener callback) into the store during the `setState` command.
	* A mixin was created here because this setting of orientation in the state is used at several places.
	* Mixins can be chained, one for each functionality.
	* If the orientation were just written in the state here, the orientation frame would also change if we are in the child component `PhotoDecide` in which we don't want the frame to change. When going back to the camera from here, we again want the frame to change, so the mixin is called here, when the state is set.


## React tips and tricks

Note that native HTML element names start with a lowercase letter, while custom React class names begin with an uppercase letter.

### Only render if existing

```js
<View>
	{renderEmptyState && renderEmptyState()}
</View>
```

### setState()

Only use `setState()` if you use that part of state in `render()` function. Otherwise it's a performance waste!


## Manual setup

When not using `create-react-app` or another setup where React is preconfigured, do the following:

Include in main html file:

```html
<script src="link/to/react.min.js"></script>
<script src="link/to/JSXTransformer.js"></script>
```

Call scripts from global folder `/js/` which runs in a browser where the root is the current folder:

```html
<script type="text/jsx;harmony=true" src="/js/components/TaskList.js"></script>
```

At bottom of root component include

```js
React.render(<MyRootComponent />, document.body);
```

## React discussion

The following answers questions about `react` like:

* Can I build something complex with React?
* Who Uses React.js?
* Can React be used with other JavaScript MVC Frameworks? (e.g. also Ember)
