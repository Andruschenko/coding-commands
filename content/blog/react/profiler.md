# React profiler

[Good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00RoZflFE34)

### Profiler

Gives you per component

* duration of load
* amount of renders

### Solutions

* Wrap component in `React.memo`
* Use `useMemo` hook for values which don't have to be recomputed in every render
* Use **lazy loading** if a lot of things are rendered on a page and not everything is needed at once.
