## Learn

Read documentation

```bash
rustup doc
```

## Values

Can either be a `mutable reference`, a `sharable reference` or a `value`.

## Packages

Build front-ends with Rust: [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew)

## Literals vs variables

### Error

The following throws the error `error: expected a literal` because the `println!` macro expects a **string literal** and not an `identifier`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = "hello";
    println!(c);
}
```

### Solution

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = "hello";
    println!("{}", c);
}
```

### Why?

> [The error message is] not ambiguous, but it does make the assumption you know what a "literal" is. `"foo"` is a **string literal**. `8` is a **numeric literal**. `let s = "foo"` is assigning the value of a **string literal** to an **identifier** (variable), and `println!(s)` is a **statement** that provides/passes an identifier to the **macro**.

#### What is a literal?

> a **literal** is a notation for representing a fixed value **in source code**.

> Contrast this with **identifiers**, which refer to a value **in memory**.
