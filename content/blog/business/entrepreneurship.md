## Zero to 1

Some takeaways from Peter Thiel's book.

### Secrets

* What secrets are people not telling you?
  * Secrets, people don't know about themselves
  * Secrets, they **hide** because they don't want others to know.

Ask yourself
* What is forbidden or taboo?
* What are people not allowed to talk about?

Best place to look for secrets is where no one else is **looking** ðŸ‘€.

Gary Vaynerchuk said on Instagram: Go **acyclical**! If they don't do things a certain way in a particular industry, do it. E.g. if pharmacy is not on Instagram, go there.
