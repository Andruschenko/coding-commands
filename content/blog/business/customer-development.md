Don't ask hypothetical questions! [Here's a summary](https://medium.com/@feelinspired/things-i-learnt-the-mom-test-by-rob-fitzpatrick-9d9d58ce8098).

[Another take on this in this blog article](https://medium.dave-bailey.com/what-you-shouldnt-ask-your-customers-a208c5dbab75).

### Good questions

* Why do you bother?
* What are the implications of that?
* Talk me through the last time that happened.
* What else have you tried?

## Emails

Rule of thumb: Personalize a little bit and get to the point fast.

### Examples of good emails

One

>Hey Thomas,
You don’t know me, but I’m getting in touch as you’re the most experienced person I’ve found working with deep tech startups in Paris.
With your experience at EF and previous roles at X and Y, I bet you’d be able to help me make sense of the struggles most startups go through in their first 14 weeks and common issues they face.
We don’t have a product, so no sales pitch to worry about - just looking to see if there are problems in this area that we’re able to solve on in future.
When can we grab 10 minutes for a call/coffee/tequila to chat?
Thanks in advance,
Jonny

Two

>Hey Thomas,
Loved the article you wrote last week on “Why most deep tech companies fail”.
Especially the part where you said “most fail as they don’t listen enough to their EiR”. So insighful!
I’m actually trying to understand the specific problems startups face in the first 14 weeks of their life.
We’re exploring whether there’s something we could create that might help solve this problem, but really need more insights from an expert like you...
Any chance we could grab a call or coffee over the next few weeks?
Jonny

Three

>Hey Thomas,
Was talking with Jean Paul Gaultier the other day and he said you’re the best person to speak to when it comes to deep tech startups.
I’m looking to understand the issues they face over their first 14 weeks and with Jeff’s recommendation and your experience at EF, I’m sure you’d be a great person to speak to.
What’s the best way of us grabbing 10 minutes over the next few weeks?
Jonny

Four

>Hey Thomas,
Hoping you can help? I’m doing research on how financial service businesses are dealing with AI.
As you’re the CTO of Goldman Sachs, I’m certain you’ll have some amazing insights to share on what problems leading banks like yours are facing when it comes to AI.
I’ve got 12 PhD’s in AI/ML/RE and have multiple papers published, so if you’re willing to give me some time, I’m more than happy to share my insights from the cutting edge of the field so you know what to expect over the next 12-36 months in the market.
What’s the best way of getting a chat setup?
Jonny
